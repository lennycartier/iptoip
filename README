A tool designed to setup and maintain the IPVS table on Linux hosts.
Written in perl and using an XML configuration file in conjunction with the
ipvsadm tool, iptoip maintains the IPVS table configuration across reboots or
IP address changes.
Useful for maintaining an IPVS table on a dynamic IP address or intermittent
connection.

USAGE:
Define a listening port in your firewall config,
For example http (port 80):
	iptables -A INPUT -i $EXTIF -p tcp -d $ANY --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
		$EXTIF is your external interface.
		$ANY is a range of IPs in your private network.
		It really should be a single IP address.
Don't ask for advice about firewall rules, as we are not experts.

Edit /etc/iptoip.xml to reflect your desired IPVS configuration.
This XML file is well documented.
Read the included manpages.

When the IP changes on $EXTIF, you can run `iptoip` to update your IPVS table
to the new IP without changing configuration files or rewriting IPVS rules. :-)

iptoip can be used in a reconnect script or as part of the netwrok interface
initialization routines.
On debien hosts, creating a symlink to iptoip in /etc/network/if-up.d can
accomplish this.
