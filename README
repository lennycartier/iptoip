iptoip is a perl script to help maintaining an ipvsadm table on a non fixed 
ip adress or an intermitent connection.

USAGE :

- First you have to define in your router firewall config a listening port,
for example the http port (80) :
      ipchains -A input  -i $EXTIF -p tcp -d $ANY 80 -j ACCEPT
don't ask me for firewall rules, I'm not an expert. $EXTIF is your external
interface, maybe ppp0 and $ANY is a range of computers in your private 
network but can be replaced (I think it should !) by a single ip adress.

- Next edit /etc/iptoip.xml to reflect wich port you want to forward to 
which computer. This xml file shoulf be well documented so I hope you'll
understand it :)

	* weight = is the weight of the server up to 65536
	* scheduler = is the scheduler/load balancing method to use
	* origin = is where the connections are coming to
	* destination = is where the connections are going
	* port = ...if you ask...
	* iface = the external interface
	* nocheck = to check or not ?
	* verbose = verbose or no ?
	* syslog = use syslog ?

- If you want to use another file than /etc/iptoip.xml then use the -f|--file 
option as :

	./iptoip --file toto.xml
	or
	./iptoip -f toto.xml

- When your ip changes on $EXTIF the ipvasdm table is not coherent, the
only thing you have to do is to launch iptoip. A good idea is to put it 
at the end of your reconnect script.

- You must specify which kind of scheduling method you want to use
for load balancing. You can use rr,wlc,wrr,lc.
Alternatively for weighted schedulers (wlc, wrr) you can specify a weight 
value for the target server. The range is 2 to 65535. The default value is
set to 1 ( _needed_ to have a correct ipvsadm table).

- You must choose between udp and tcp protocol with the <protocol>[u|t]</protocol> tag.
